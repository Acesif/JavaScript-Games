## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating with others. With these tools, you can track changes, collaborate with others, and manage your project's history.

## Setting Up Git
1. **Installation:** Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Configuration:** Set your name and email globally:
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

Basic Git Commands
Initialize a Repository: Create a new Git repository in your project folder:

git init
Check Status: View the status of your repository:

git status
Add Changes: Add files to the staging area:

git add file.txt
Commit Changes: Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

git commit -m "Your commit message"

View Commit History: See a log of your commit history:

git log

Working with GitHub
Create a GitHub Account: Sign up at github.com.

Create a Repository: Click the '+' icon in the top-right and select 'New Repository.'

Push to GitHub: Link your local repository to a GitHub repository:


git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Collaborative Workflow
Fork a Repository: On GitHub, click 'Fork' to make a copy of someone else's repository.

Clone a Repository: Clone your fork to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-fork.git
Create a Branch: Work on a new feature or bugfix in a separate branch:


git checkout -b feature-branch

Pull Requests: When you're ready, create a pull request on GitHub to merge your changes.

Common Issues
Merge Conflicts: Resolve conflicts when Git can't automatically merge changes.
